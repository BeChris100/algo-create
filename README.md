# Algorithm Creator
Another repository based on Java. But wait, there is JavaFX now.

For a small brain of mine, I decided to write an Algorithm Creator that can be
visually made and saved as an Image, along with its Configuration, but also being
able to convert to code. Sounds good? Yeah, then let's go.

Also, don't ask, how and why I decided, not to use Maven or Gradle and still work
great with JavaFX. Two words, custom JDK. Just run `jlink` and you'll get the same
results. The only thing you need to download are the jmod files, and you'll be able
to create your own JavaFX JDK. I will make a JDK Creator soon, so any of you will be
able to make your own JDKs.
